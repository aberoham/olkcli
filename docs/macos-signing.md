# macOS release signing

macOS release binaries use Developer ID with a stable identifier, hardened
runtime, and an Apple timestamp. Signing fails closed when credentials are
missing or the signature does not match the configured team and identity.

The `release` GitHub environment holds `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` (the
base64-encoded, password-protected PKCS #12 certificate/private-key bundle)
and `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`. Its variables are `MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY`
(the certificate SHA-1 fingerprint) and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. Restrict this
environment to the release tags accepted by the workflow. Require approval
by `aberoham`, allow self-review, and disable administrator bypass. Protect
`v*` tags with an admin-only creation/update/deletion ruleset. These live
settings must be applied before the workflow is enabled. The job actor guard
is defense in depth; it cannot replace these server-side controls. Review
the tagged workflow and signing script before approving a deployment.

The signing helper imports into a temporary keychain under `RUNNER_TEMP`,
adds Apple's public G2 intermediate, and restores the original keychain search
list during unconditional cleanup. It does not change certificate trust or
import credentials into the login keychain. The public intermediate is from
https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/DeveloperIDG2CA.cer.

Signing runs after compilation and before release checksums are generated.
Keep the signing identifier stable across versions. Existing keychain items
created by older signatures may require one approval or a new sign-in. A
successful release signature does not prove that existing keychain grants
have migrated. Do not re-sign these release binaries with a local certificate.

## Notarization

The same environment also holds `APPLE_NOTARY_KEY_P8_BASE64`, with variables
`APPLE_NOTARY_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`. The API key has the
Developer role. GoReleaser builds unsigned archives on a separate runner.
A read-only signing job signs and notarizes each macOS binary without running
build hooks or the binaries. The notary key is decoded only during each
submission/wait and removed on exit. Publication runs on a third runner with
no Apple credentials, and computes checksums over the final signed archives.
Bare binaries cannot be stapled; macOS checks the ticket online. The cask
preserves quarantine. A notarization timeout stops publication; inspect the
submission status before retrying a release.
